## Marketplace Installation

1. Go to **Main Menu > Plugin Marketplace** in Workchat.
2. Search for "Nagios" or find the plugin from the list.
3. Select **Install**.
4. When the plugin has downloaded and been installed, select **Configure**.

## Manual Installation

If your server doesn't have access to the internet, you can download the latest plugin binary release and upload it to your server via **System Console > Plugin Management**. The releases on this page are the same used by the Marketplace. To learn more about how to upload a plugin, see the documentation.

Ensure you configure the plugin before you enable it.
